## Description

I was given a starter code and was tasked with modifying the code to make it follow accessibilty standards. This would ensure that individuals with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

This code was also modified to include semantic elements which helps people and the browsers distinguish the difference between the sections of a web page. This allows the contents of the web page to be more sustainable and more useful into the future. Some examples of semantic elements are `<header>`, `<footer>`, or `<section>`.
