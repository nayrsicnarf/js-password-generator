## Description

In this assignment, I was tasked into creating a password generator using JavaScript. In this application, the user is prompted to input the desired amount of chracters they want in their password based off the given parameters. If in the event that the user chooses a value outside of the given parameters, the user is receives a prompt to choose a number within the parameters and try again. Once that value is chosen, the user is prompted to choose which of the following character types they want in their password:

- Lowercase Characters
- Uppercase Characters
- Numeric Characters
- Special Characters

If the user does not choose at least one of the four character types, they are told to try again. After the desired character types have been chosen, a random psssowrd is generated and displayed on the screen for the user to see.

This assignment was our introduction to JavaScript. I did not modify the HTML or the CSS files in order to accomplish this assignment. I became familiar with methods such as `<.concat>` which is a method to merge two or more arrays. Some functinos that I became familiar with are `<Math.floor>` and `<Math.random>`. The former returns a number that's rounded down to its closest integer. The latter returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1, which is what allows us to randomly select a character in each desired character type.
